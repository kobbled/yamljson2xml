# <- yaml supports comments, json does not
# did you know you can embed json in yaml?
# try uncommenting the next line
# { foo: 'bar' }

json:
  - rigid
  - better for data interchange
yaml:
  - slim and flexible
  - better for configuration
attr:
  "@key": value
  "#value": "some text"
object:
  key: value
  array:
    - null_value:
    - boolean: true
    - integer: 1
    - "#text": "some text"
paragraph: >
   Blank lines denote

   paragraph breaks
content: |-
   Or we
   can auto
   convert line breaks
   to save space
